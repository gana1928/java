This is another great story that teaches a lesson thatâ€™s written for kids but adults can enjoy, too. 
The story tells of a grasshopper who lounges around all summer while his friend the ant prepares for the winter. 
When winter comes, the two friends end up in very different situations!

The moral is that those who save up during the good times will get to enjoy the benefits when times are bad.
